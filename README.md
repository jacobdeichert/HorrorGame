- add everyone to this repo








### development branch created

I created a branch called **development** as Taso suggested. For now, I guess we should keep the **master** branch clean. You will notice the **master** branch is the only branch with a **CHANGELOG** file and this **README** file. I thought it might be useful to create a **CHANGELOG** file so that each of us can describe what changes we make in each push.

In the **development** branch you will notice a **unity_project** folder which holds the game files. At the moment, I just uploaded a basic project. I then recreated each person's branch based off of the development branch. Therefore, each person currently has the basic project inside their branch.



### students get 5 free private repos

If you would like to get 5 free private repos, you just have to give github your humber email address and you might have to send them a short message about what you would use it for. I did it over a year ago, but I think I went here https://github.com/edu and clicked on **I'm a student**... then follow the instructions from there.



### tip with gitignore files

If any of you heard what I was having problems with today, it was that I had a global git ignore file located on my computer that I forgot about. This file was ignoring some of unity's required files... which messed with all my prefabs. So don't make the same mistake as me! Also, make sure not to delete the **.gitignore** and **.gitattributes** files within your branch.



### git questions or problems?

I've been using git and github for almost 2 years now, hopefully I can help if anyone has any questions or problems.
