## working_project folder

This is the new base project folder that everyone should add their stuff too. If you're still experimenting with a feature, work inside your own folder inside **feature_testing**. So far, the base project has the maze generating with traps and no errors. There are a few trap rotation bugs that still have to be fixed.
