TerrOut Horror Game Project
===========================

Check out the development branch for the actual game.

You are dropped into a maze and must escape before you die. To escape, find the white wall and step towards it (the end). There's a monster in the maze that follows noise based on loudness. Mazes are randomly generated, so good luck in finding the exit. Don't stand still for too long, the monster is fast and will find you. You can sprint faster than him though.

### Callouts (only with keyboard)
Press Enter to bring up the chat box. Type in one of the commands listed below to make that callout. We originally had these callouts for if there was 2 players in the game.. it was going to be a multiplayer game, but we ran out of time. You'll notice that there is up/down voice volume buttons, again these were for multiplayer purposes, however the louder your voice volume is, the more likely the monster will hear it.
