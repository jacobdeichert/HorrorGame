# README!!!


## todo
- add section about Github for Windows
- talk about changelog file
- encourage people to create branches for each feature, then merge into dev branch



### github for windows
If you don't like SourceTree, check out [**GitHub for Windows**](http://windows.github.com).




### development branch created

I created a branch called **development** as Taso suggested. For now, I guess we should keep the **master** branch clean. You will notice the **master** branch is the only branch with a **CHANGELOG** file and this **README** file. I thought it might be useful to create a **CHANGELOG** file so that each of us can describe what changes we make in each push.

In the **development** branch you will notice a **unity_project** folder which holds the game files. At the moment, I just uploaded a basic project. I then recreated each person's branch based off of the development branch. Therefore, each person currently has the basic project inside their branch.



### students get 5 free private repos

If you would like to get 5 free private repos, you just have to give github your humber email address and you might have to send them a short message about what you would use it for. I did it over a year ago, but I think I went here https://github.com/edu and clicked on **I'm a student**... then follow the instructions from there.



### tips

- make sure not to delete the **.gitignore** file in each branch
- create all new branches based off of the development branch



### git questions or problems?

I've been using git and github for almost 2 years now, hopefully I can help if anyone has any questions or problems.
