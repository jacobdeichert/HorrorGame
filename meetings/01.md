## Pathing between tiles

Matt's path algorithm can be applied to the map.



## Co-op or versus

- need sense of direction to find other player
        - hear a noise, show direction noise came from
                - mini-map, kind of like sonar
        - once player's find each other, work together to find exit

- depending how loud your voice commands are, other player and monster may hear you
    - monster follows noise

- some or all traps have switches
    - flick the switch to deactive/reactivate
    - when switched, other random trap is reactivated/deactivated



## Things to do

**High priority**
- map generation

**Low priority**
- fatigue bar
