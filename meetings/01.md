## I will add more detail to this file later tonight. - Jake

# TODO
- check position is in center of 10x10x10 tile

# Pathing between tiles
Matt and Eric work on that part.

# Co-op or versus
Need sense of direction to find other player.
Hear a noise, show direction noise came from. Sonar.
Change volume of yelling, monster may come find you.
Every trap have a switch, deactivate a trap, reactivate a random trap.

Once players find each other, they now have to find the exit.

Low priority
- fatigue bar

High priority
- map generation
